## About the book

If you are a person who is just getting started with web development, the ideas in this book will allow you to level up and build interactive, animated web interfaces without knowing much about JavaScript.

If you are a JavaScript developer, then this book will remind you that there are many many things we can build with these simple languages without having to touch JavaScript at all.

In this book we will push the limits of whatâ€™s possible with just simple HTML and CSS!

Starting with the anchor element, we will build scrolling and animating carousels, image maps with dynamic, dismissible popups then move onto investigating mouse and keyboard interactions, toggle and focus states.

We will then move onto calculating and counting with CSS: we will build an analogue and a digital clock, a calorie counter and a shopping basket.

Finally, with the checkbox and radio buttons we will push things even further and build a content accordion three ways, a tab interface and even a fully functioning star rating component.
